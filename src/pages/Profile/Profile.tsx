                        Hi, I'm a self-taught front-end developer trying to get my first job. I've done Argentina programa 2 (gov
                        course) but felt really lonely in the process, so I learned how to manage my time and resources to learn by
                        myself. In this way, I believe it reflects my personality. I was in front of a challenge and did everything to
                        do my best to achieve the challenge. I had to overcome frustration, use a lot of google, read a lot of documentation, and stay long nights at the pc. Besides that course, I continue to study on my own.
                        Additionally, I have a strong background in industrial design, I worked with a team on a year-long project that involved conducting user research, creating journey maps, performing benchmarking, developing
                        proto-personas, generating concepts, and conducting sprints to create an MVP. Through this experience, I
                        learned how to apply design thinking to real-world challenges and to create solutions that truly meet
                        the needs of users.
                        I see myself as a self-motivated person who is committed to delivering quality results, and I'm excited to
                        bring my enthusiasm and skills to a dynamic team environment
                    </p>
