Experientia

I am currently redesigning an MVP that was developed during a year-long project in my university's Industrial Design Workshop IV course. 
The goal of the project was to identify a problem and develop a solution that takes into consideration the user and context. To achieve this, we conducted 
interviews with direct and indirect users, created journey maps, brainstormed ideas, etc. and developed concepts before arriving at the MVP.

The MVP connects students, professors, and professionals to facilitate information sharing and job opportunities. Our ultimate aim is to simplify the 
process of finding the right career and connecting with the job market.
